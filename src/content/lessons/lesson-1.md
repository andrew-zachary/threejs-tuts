Three.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics on the web. 
It makes it easier for developers to work with WebGL, a low-level 3D graphics API, by abstracting away many of its complexities. This allows developers to create interactive and visually appealing 3D experiences for their websites.
